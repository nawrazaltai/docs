## Start the setup with update and upgrade:
* Login to the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server on VirtualBox.
* Make yourself root
    ```
    ninja@altai:~$ sudo su
    [sudo] password for ninja:
    root@altai:/home/ninja#
    ```
    
* Check availabe updates with 'apt update'
    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# apt update
    ...

    5 packages can be upgraded. Run 'apt list --upgradable' to see them.
    root@altai:/home/ninja#
    ```
* Upgrade to the available updates with 'apt upgrade'
    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# apt upgrade
    ...
    After this operation, 378 MB of additional disk space will be used.
    Do you want to continue? [Y/n] y
    ...
    done
    root@altai:/home/ninja#
    ```
## Setup SSH-key:
* Start by generating a key pair on the client machine
    ```
    Π ssh-keygen
    ```
* The following output appeared, I pressed enter and saved the key at the defualt path
    ```
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/Hp/.ssh/id_rsa):
    ```
    
* As I already got an existing key on the client machine, this appeared next
    ```
    /c/Users/Hp/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
    Overwrite (y/n)? y
    ```
    * I entered 'y' to overwrite the existing key.

* Next you will be asked to enter a passphrase, I left it empty to not use a passphrase
    ```
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    ```
* By now the key should be generated and saved with this output
    ```
    Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/Hp/.ssh/id_rsa
    Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/Hp/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:ybB8lFsaPGgwyMDakclppYM9WsWbFx3gr9qGW3ZmsQc Hp@DESKTOP-OE4AU12
    The key's randomart image is:
    +---[RSA 3072]----+
    |o+ B= .o..       |
    | +Xo.+.o..       |
    |oo*. o=.* .      |
    |.o.ooo.* B       |
    |.    .o E        |
    |       o +       |
    |     .+ = .      |
    |    .=.+ .       |
    |    oo.          |
    +----[SHA256]-----+
    ```
* Next, by using 'ssh-copy-id username@remote_host' I copied the public key from the client machine in to the server

    ```
    Π ssh-copy-id ninja@192.168.10.152
    ```
    
* With the following output, I entered the password for my user at the server to add the new key
    ```
    /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/c/Users/Hp/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
    /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
    /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
    ninja@192.168.10.152's password: 
    ```
    
* I got this output to confirm that the key was added to the server
    ```
    Number of key(s) added: 1
    Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'ninja@192.168.10.152'"
    and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
    ```
    
* Final step was to check if I could connect to the server from the local client without typing in a password
    ```
    Π ssh ninja@192.168.10.152
    Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-86-generic x86_64)
    ...
    ninja@altai:~$
    ```
    
## Install and configurate dropbear
##### Installing dropbear:
* First step is to use apt to install dropbear

    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# apt install dropbear
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree
    Reading state information... Done
    dropbear is already the newest version (2019.78-2build1).
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
    root@altai:/home/ninja#
    ```
##### Configurating dropbear:

* I used nano as an editor to configurate dropbear
    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# nano /etc/default/dropbear
    ```
* Inside the file I made the following changes (modified NO_START and DROPBEAR_PORT):
    ```
    # disabled because OpenSSH is installed
    # change to NO_START=0 to enable Dropbear
    NO_START=0 #was 1
    # the TCP port that Dropbear listens on
    DROPBEAR_PORT=33000 #was 22
    ```
* To activate the changes I restarted dropbear
    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# systemctl restart dropbear
    ```    

* From a new local shell I made sure that dropbear is working and that I can connect to the server with my new custom port
    ```
    Π ssh -p 33000 ninja@192.168.10.152
    ...
    ninja@altai:~$
    ```
    
## Install ufw(firewall)
* As root I installed ufw on the server

    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# apt install ufw
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree
    Reading state information... Done
    ufw is already the newest version (0.36-6ubuntu1).
    ufw set to manually installed.
    0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
    root@altai:/home/ninja#
    ```
* As ufw was already installed on the server, I checked its status
    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# ufw status verbose
    Status: inactive
    root@altai:/home/ninja#
    ```
* I allow port 33000, it's the port I configured on dropbear
    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# ufw allow 33000/tcp
    Rules updated
    Rules updated (v6)
    root@altai:/home/ninja#
    ```

* Next I enabled ufw
    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# ufw enable
    Command may disrupt existing ssh connections. Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
    Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
    ```
* And checked the ufw status to make sure it is active    
    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# ufw status verbose
    Status: active
    Logging: on (low)
    Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), disabled (routed)
    New profiles: skip
    To                         Action      From

    33000/tcp                  ALLOW IN    Anywhere
    33000/tcp (v6)             ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
    root@altai:/home/ninja#
    ```

## Stop and remove built-in SSH service

* As sudo I stopped the built-in SSH service
    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# systemctl stop ssh
    root@altai:/home/ninja# 
    ```
    
* With apt I removed the openssh-server
    ```
    root@altai:/home/ninja# apt remove openssh-server
